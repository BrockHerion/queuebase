# Logging

Logging is a critical part of any application. It helps you understand what's happening in your application, diagnose problems, and monitor performance. Queuebase provides a simple logging system that you can use to log messages from your jobs.

## Adding Logging

To log messages from your jobs, Queuebase exposes a `logger` object that you can use in your job handlers. The logger will log to your console and to the Queuebase dashboard, allowing you to view your run logs there.

The logger is exposed as a parameter in your job handler function. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```ts
export const jobRouter = {
  sayHello: j().handler(({ logger }) => {
    logger.info("Hello there!");
  }),
} satisfies QueuebaseJobRouter;
```

## Methods

The logger object exposes the following methods:

### trace

Logs a trace message.

```ts
logger.trace("This is a trace message!");
```

### debug

Logs a debug message.

```ts
logger.debug("This is a debug message!");
```




### info

Logs an informational message.

```ts
logger.info("Hello there!");
```

### success

Logs a success message.

```ts
logger.success("Job completed successfully!");
```

### warn

Logs a warning message.

```ts
logger.warn("This is a warning!");
```

### error

Logs an error message.

```ts
logger.error("Something went wrong!");
```

### fatal

Logs a fatal message.

```ts
logger.fatal("This is a fatal error!");
```
