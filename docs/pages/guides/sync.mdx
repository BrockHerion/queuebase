# Syncing Jobs

Jobs defined in your router can be synced with Queuebase. Typically, a job is synced when it's invoked. You can, however, also sync manually via the dashboard.

## Syncing Jobs Manually

To sync jobs manually, navigate to the [jobs](https://www.queuebase.com/dashboard/apps) page in the dashboard and click the "Sync Jobs" button. For this to work, you have to have exposed the `GET` endpoint in your [route handler](/getting-started/appdir#2-create-the-route-handler).
