# Delay

Sometimes you want a job to run at some point in the future. For example, you might want to send a reminder email to a user 24 hours after they sign up. You can do this by enqueueing a job with a delay.

## Enqueueing a job with a delay

When you enqueue a job, you can specify a delay in seconds. The job will be run after the specified delay has passed.

```jsx
"use client";

import { jobs } from "@/utils/queuebase";

export default function ExecuteWithDelay() {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        jobs("delayExample").enqueue(undefined, { delay: 30 });
      }}
    >
      Execute job with delay
    </button>
  );
}
```

> In the example above, there is no job payload. In this case, `undefined` is passed as the first argument to the `enqueue` method.

## Delay Constants

The Queuebase SDK provides a few constants to help you specify delays in a more readable way. These constants are in seconds. Here are some examples:

- `ONE_MINUTE` = 60 seconds.
- `ONE_HOUR` = 3600 seconds.
- `ONE_DAY` = 86400 seconds.
- `ONE_WEEK` = 604800 seconds.

These contants can be combined to customize your delay.

### Usage

```jsx
"use client";

import { jobs } from "@/utils/queuebase";
import { DELAY_TIMES } from "queuebase/constants";

export default function ExecuteWithDelay() {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        jobs("delayExample").enqueue(undefined, { delay: DELAY_TIMES.ONE_DAY });
      }}
    >
      Execute job with delay
    </button>
  );
}
```
