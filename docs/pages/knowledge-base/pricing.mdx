## Pricing Details

Queuebase pricing is based around teams. Each team has it's own subscription plan, which includes the number of jobs runs per day and a limit on the number of jobs runs per month. Metrics for each team are based off all applications under that team. Going over certain metrics, such as job runs, may incur additional charges.

For example, the Pro plan has an environment limit of 500 per team. If you create two teams with 5 environments, you will have a total of 10 environments used in your plan.

Metrics reset at the beginning of each billing period.
